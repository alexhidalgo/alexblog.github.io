I have made the leap of faith. I paid the $12,000 and moved to Austin, Texas to spend the next 12 weeks learning front-end engineering at the IronYard, an intensive coding school that trains the best and the brightest.

Fast forward a few hours since I started writing. I finished my first day and I am absolutely, 100% in love with myself for making the decision to become a developer for once and for all. I couldn’t have done anything better and the fact that this is all a reality is just surreal. Today I met with all my classmates, who are all brilliant and awesome in their own right, and our instructors are fantastic with tons of experience and the right attitude to help us newbies☺

After the introductions we went straight into reviewing HTML5, and CSS3 which we taught ourselves weeks prior to starting school. Its all smooth sailing for me for this first week since I’ve been studying my butt off the month prior. HTML and CSS seem pretty straightforward so I’ll spend my evenings getting ahead with javascript prototypes and scoping issues.

Stay tuned for more updates on this crazy adventure we call the Iron Yard Experience.
